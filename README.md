# Google-Sheets-MC-Simulator
Google Apps Script utility to run MC simulations

This script draws MC simulations from a google sheet. Variables are set up as random variables in the spreadsheet, and calculations laid out just as usual in the spreadsheet.

The script recalculates the sheet, thereby drawing new random numbers, and collects the results of specified cells.
